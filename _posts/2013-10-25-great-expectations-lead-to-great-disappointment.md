title: Great expectations lead to great disappointment
---

That's right, I had great expectations which were **not fulfilled** and I'm **not impressed**. I'm talking about the latest update of **Apple**'s operating system **OS X**.

## What I expected

I've been using **Mountain Lion** for a few months now with two displays, one built-in and one external. The external one is Full HD, so it has a bit more pixels than the **MacBook**'s display. It was usable when I didn't need to disconnect the secondary monitor to bring the laptop with me or have applications in fullscreen mode. The problem with the **fullscreen** was simple, the **OS X** behaved like each of its spaces was simply one area, spanning through both displays, so when you made one application fullscreen, the other display was just grey (with that fancy pattern). What a waste of space. Then there's the other problem of disconnecting the secondary display which has resulted in moving all the windows from it to the Mac's display without any resizing. Messy as hell.

For **Mavericks**, Apple promised they will try to make better multi-display support. That gave me a hope that it might finally take each space separately and not try to merge it when I disconnect the second display. It'd be also just great if it tried to resize the windows in correct ratio.

The other thing I was looking for were tabs in Finder. It sounds silly when you say:

> "**For a next iteration of Apple's operation system, the second most expected thing are tabs in the file explorer.**"

but I really miss them even on Windows.

## What has been delivered

Let's start with the minor things. 

### Maps

Looks great, feels great, but I'll be still using **Google Maps** in browser. Also, I think that this should be in **App Store** and not preinstalled.

### iBooks

Another app that's useless for me and I'd rather download it from **App Store** if I wanted.

### Tags in Finder

I might use these, but right now I didn't even get to try them. I'll see soon enough if there's any use for them for me.

### Tabs in Finder

I'm excited about these, as it's a great step toward more effective work with files on Mac.

### Notifications on lock screen

I like it, since my password is rather long, so I have time to check up on what's waiting for me when I log in. For people with a shorter password, I'm not sure if there is any use for this feature.

### Multi-display support

Here we go, the feature I got disappointed about the most. Of course they improved it, it's easy to improve **nothing**. But to me, it's a **half-baked shit**. I mean it! There is no configuration, there is no way to disable some things I don't like, nothing. I know that **Apple** does decide the majority of things for the users, so we don't have to. But let's be honest, how many simple users are using multiple screens? So wouldn't it be a good idea to let us decide how we like it? For example, the dock. There's no way to set it to appear only on one display and never on the second one! However there are some fullscreen apps that work great and I like how **Apple** made them. The same applies for other spaces, as it finally appears that they are separate and you can even have different count of spaces on each display. This leads me to the secondary display disconnection. (It's just terrible and you won't like what will happen). When you disconnect the other screen, it'll try to merge your spaces and move windows to your primary display. **No horizontal resizing** is done, so the windows are wider than my screen. It's just ugly and has no sense. Alright, if they didn't want to resize the windows, they should have made it in a way that it would just move whole spaces. In that case, if I had three spaces on primary display and two spaces on secondary, I'd have five spaces after the disconnection. Apps in fullscreen mode work that way, they just move to the primary display. It's brilliant and **Apple** should have gone this way with spaces as well.

## Conclusion

Even though I'm really disappointed by the **Mavericks**, I'm still grateful even for the small changes. But since it was in a form of a free update, maybe that's why I feel like that, because if I had to pay for this, man I'd be pissed as hell.
