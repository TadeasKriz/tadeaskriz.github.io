title: Great expectations lead to great disappointment
---

That's right, I had great expectations, which were **not fulfilled** and I'm **not impressed**. I'm talking about the latest update of **Apple**'s operating system **OS X**.

## What I expected

I've been using **Mountain Lion** for a few months now with two displays, one built-in and one external. The external one is Full HD, so it has a bit more pixels than the **MacBook**'s display. It was usable, when I didn't need to disconnect the secondary monitor, to bring the laptop with me, or have applications in fullscreen mode. The problem with the **fullscreen** was simple, the **OS X** behaved like each of its spaces was simply one area, spanning through both displays, so when you made one application fullscreen, the other display was just grey (with that fancy pattern). What a waste of space. Then there's the other problem, disconnecting the secondary display, resulted moving all the windows from it to the Mac's display, without any resizing. Messy as hell.

For **Mavericks**, Apple promised there will be a lot made for better multi-display support. That gave me a hope, that it might finally take each space separately, and not try to merge it when I disconnect the second display. Also, it'd be just great if it tried to resize the windows in correct ratio.

The other thing I was looking for, is tabs in Finder. It sounds silly, when you say

> "**For a next iteration of Apple's operation system, the second most expected thing are tabs in the file explorer.**"

but I really miss them even on Windows.

## What has been delivered

Let's start with the minor things. 

### Maps

Looks great, feels great, but I'm still about to be using **Google Maps** in browser. Also I think that this should be in **App Store** and not preinstalled.

### iBooks

Another app that's useless for me and I'd rather download it from **App Store** if I wanted.

### Tags in Finder

I might use those, but right now I didn't get to even try them. I'll see soon enough if there's any use for them for me.

### Tabs in Finder

I'm excited about these, as it's a great step toward more effective work with files on Mac.

### Notifications on lock screen

I like it, as my password is rather long, so I got the time to check up with what's waiting for me when I log in. For people with shorter password, I'm not sure there is any use for this feature.

### Multi-display support

Here we go, the feature I got disappointed about the most. Of course they improved it, it's easy to improve **nothing**. But to me, it's **half-baked shit**. I mean it! There is no configuration, there is no way to disable some things I don't like, nothing. I know that **Apple** does decide the majority of things for the users, so we don't have to. But be honest, how many simple users are using multiple screens? So wouldn't it be a good idea, to let us decide, how we like it? For example, the dock. There's no way to set it to appear only on one display and never on the second one! Then there are fullscreen apps, which works great and I like how **Apple** made these. The same applies for other spaces, as it finally appears, that they are separate and you can even have different count of spaces on each display. This leads me to the secondary display disconnection. That's just terrible and you won't like what'll happen. When you disconnect the other screen, it'll try to merge your spaces and move windows to your primary display. **No horizontal resizing** is done so the windows are wider than my screen. This is just ugly and has no sense. Alright, if they didn't want to resize the windows, they should have made it the way, that it would just move whole spaces. In that case, if I had 3 spaces on primary display and two spaces on secondary, I'd have five spaces after the disconnection. Apps in fullscreen mode works that way, they just move to the primary display. That's brilliant and **Apple** should have gone this way with spaces as well.

## Conclusion

Even though I'm really disappointed by the **Mavericks**, I'm still grateful even for the small changes. Maybe that's only because it was in a form of a free update, because if I had to pay for this, man I'd be pissed as hell.
