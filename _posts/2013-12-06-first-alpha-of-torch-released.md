title: First alpha of Torch released!
---

I'm very proud to announce, that our Android ORM library **Torch** has just reached the state, in which I consider it featureful enough to be released. In the upcoming weeks and possibly months, I'll be focusing on polishing the API, extending SPI, implementing missing features, like relations between entities or better column filters, but mostly on documenting the library.

For more information head to [https://github.com/brightify/torch](https://github.com/brightify/torch) to learn more. The wiki on the github contains some basic information on how to work with entities. I'll add how to setup the library in your project very soon.
