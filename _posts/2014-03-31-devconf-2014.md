It's been a while since I had a presentation on DevConf 2014 in Brno and I decided it's finally time to write something about it. The event was three days long and even though I've been there only the first day, I really enjoyed it. I attended two talks and one workshop. The first talk I was on, has been about web application development using Web Components by Lukas Fryc. Although I'm not really a web developer anymore and it was only to broaden my knowledge, I liked the talk and didn't get much confused by all the code in the slides. After that I went to Thermostat workshop by Severin Gehwolf, again mostly out of curiosity. Unfortunately I didn't get to find a free spot by a computer, so I was only listening. The last talk was about REST APIs and how to report errors in processing requests by Ivan Necas. All those were great and I just wish I had the time to attend talks on Saturday and Sunday.

### My talk
I talked about the [AeroGear][1] library and you can find the whole talk on [YouTube][2] and slides on [Google Drive][3]. That was my first talk in English and even though I believe I have a lot to work on (speaking of my presentation skills), I've been told people liked it. There was one major fail and that was the live coding demo. Being under stress, I've overlooked a name of a method I was implementing and because of that the application was not showing any data. I wish I looked into the code a bit more, but I didn't want to waste time and people's attention on debugging the code. The other demo's code is available on GitHub. It's very simple TODO list application for both Android and iOS. It doesn't support any kind of authentication and all the tasks are synchronized across all connected devices.
