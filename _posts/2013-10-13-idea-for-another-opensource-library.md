title: Idea for another opensource library
---
While working on the **Torch**, an idea for another library came up in my mind. Codenamed **Neteasy**, it will be a fresh networking library, based on solid and easy to use API. It's gonna be based on our internal networking library written for real-time games, but with polished API.
