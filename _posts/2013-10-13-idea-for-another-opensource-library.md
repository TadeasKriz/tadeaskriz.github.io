title: Idea for another opensource library
---
While I'm working on the **Torch**, an idea for another library came up in my mind. Codenamed **Neteasy** will be a fresh networking library, based on solid and easy to use API. It's gonna be based on our internal networking library written for real-time games, but with polished API.
