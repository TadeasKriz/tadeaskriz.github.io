We have just released a small application called **AutoAmplifier**. Its main goal is to adjust your music volume based on surrounding noises. That way when you, for example, decide to leave a library and get on a train, you won't need to reach out for your phone to increase the volume, **AutoAmplifier** will do that for you.
